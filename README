# Computer Architecture Workshop

This repository contains example code used to illustrate the process of transforming high-level code into an executable (not tested).

`asm` contains an example of turning a simple program into assembly code:

1. `cd asm`
2. `make clean all`

If you do not have gcc installed, please add `CC=<your compiler>` to the end of (2), for example, `make clean all CC=clang`

`map` contains an example of turning a simple program into a full executable, along with assembly and map file. It is compiled with `arm-none-eabi-gcc` for an ARM
architecture target, such as a 32-bit microcontroller. To use it:

1. `cd map`
2. `make clean all`

If you do not have gcc, again please try your local compiler.

Thanks!
